# The Latest on TypeScript (2016)

TypeScript, introduced by Microsoft in October 2012, is a strict superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing and ES2015/++ language features such as classes, modules, arrow functions, decorators, async/await, and more. TypeScript's static typing allows tooling to provide richer support for features such as symbol-based navigation, statement completion, and code refactoring. All of this together helps ease the development of JavaScript applications.

In this talk, we'll start with a brief history of TypeScript followed by a series of interactive demos that will show you the basics of the language. Then we'll look at some of the more advanced language features using Angular 2, React, and Node.js. We'll also see how popular editors like GitHub's Atom and Microsoft's Visual Studio Code provide support for working with TypeScript.
